# Project Work for Data Driven Modeling of Dynamical System ðŸŽ“
This is the repository for the project of DDMDS course @ POLIMI held by Professor Mara Tanelli in A.Y. 2021/2022. <br/>
The purpose of this project was to test whether it was possible to predict the occurrence of an earthquake and at what interval in advance. I decided to create a black box to model the vibration time series and then analyze the residuals and check for behavior other than expected using control charts to raise an alarm. <br/>
<br/>
The PW was made using matlab and the structure of the repository is the one below.
